Hi, this is my first React project. For the first time I touched this library in December 2019 during my internship at PlanMill Oy. Since then I invested a bit more time into learning that technology. It took me approximately one month (with breaks for work, studying, etc.) to build this app. Technologies used:

React (React.Fragment, Conditional rendering, Context),
React Hooks (useContext)
React Router (Switch, Link, Router),
Bootstrap 4

If you liked my app or especially there things which could be better, give me a feedback! You can always reach me via e-mail kdmitrijv@gmail.com




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
